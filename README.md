# SpartanPHP
- Encrypt is quite powerful for the PHP language to protect your code from people who steal or try to reveal the source code.
- You should edit in `settings.json`

# Note
- This software only runs software like [PocketMine](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP) or the autoload mechanism like PocketMine does not support static software.

# Settings
```json
{
    "hard_crypt": 1000, // This is the difficulty for your source code.
    "path_environment": "start.cmd", // This is your environment file such as the start.cmd of a piece of software to run it overall.
    "path_project": "your_path", // The path to use for encoding as well as running encoded codes.
    "quality_runtime": 5 // Timeout to check input and output quality when running the environment as well as encode.
}
```

# Next Update
- UI for SpartanPHP
- Add in environmental fluctuations for better navigation.
