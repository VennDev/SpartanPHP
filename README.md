## How to run file encoded ❔ ##
### Windows ###
- Just run file encoded with cmd `php name_file.php`
### Linux x86_64 ###
- You must run with cmd `sudo php name_file.php`
- After you type your password
- Or you can **sudo** file this to install **Spartan Loader** [Click Here!](https://github.com/VennDev/SpartanPHP/tree/main/installer)
- Do the above actions to complete the download of a **Spartan** loader for `linux`!
- From here you can run all `.php` files encoded by **Spartan**.
### Linux Arm x64 ###
- Also similar to `linux x86_64` however there are some things that are different if you are knowledgeable about how to add `php.ini` configuration to your php and run it similar to the steps of `linux x86_64`
