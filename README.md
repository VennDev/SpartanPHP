# SpartanPHP
- Encrypt is quite powerful for the PHP language to protect your code from people who steal or try to reveal the source code.
- You should edit in `settings.json`

# Note
- This software only runs software like [PocketMine](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP) or the autoload mechanism like PocketMine does not support static software.
